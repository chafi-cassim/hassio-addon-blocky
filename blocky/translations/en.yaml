configuration:
  router:
    name: Router IP Address
    description: Configure a DNS server for client lookup, typically your router. Blocky uses reverse DNS (rDNS) to identify client names.

  defaultUpstreamResolvers:
    name: Default DNS resolvers
    description: Specify external DNS resolvers for query resolution. Supported protocols include UDP/TCP (tcp+udp), DNS over HTTPS (https), and DNS over TLS (tcp-tls).

  bootstrapDns:
    name: Bootstrap DNS Servers
    description: Define DNS servers for resolving blacklist URLs and upstream DNS servers by hostname. These are used if no system DNS resolver is configured or to encrypt bootstrap queries. Specify just the upstream for IP-based upstreams, omitting the ips field.

  conditionalMapping:
    name: Domain-Specific DNS Resolvers
    description: Redirect DNS queries for specific domains (and their subdomains) to designated DNS resolvers. Useful for routing local network queries to your router, as it can map hostnames to IP addresses within your network.

  blackLists:
    name: Blacklist Groups and Sources
    description: Configure groups of external blacklists to block domains or IPs (e.g., ads, malware). Supports Hosts format, plain domain lists, and regex patterns. Use DNS sinkholing to block queries, checking request domains, response IPs, and CNAME records against these blacklists. Include whitelists to prevent over-blocking.

  clientGroupsBlock:
    name: Client-Specific Blocking Groups
    description: Assign blocking groups to specific network clients. Use client names, IPs, FQDNs, or CIDR notations for identification. Clients are assigned to the default group if no specific group is set. Blocky resolves FQDNs to apply group settings based on IP matches.

  caching:
    name: Caching
    description: Configure DNS caching settings. Blocky caches DNS responses according to their TTL values to reduce traffic and improve response times by serving results from cache.

network:
  53/udp: UDP port for DNS requests.
  53/tcp: TCP port for DNS requests.
